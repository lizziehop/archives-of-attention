# Archives of Attention
Materials, documentation, and other files for Archives of Attention, a Digital Humanities project interested in what print culture can tell us about 19th century US-American manias, novelties, distractions, and fashionable amusements. What were people paying attention to in the 19th century, and how was attention conceptualized, vied for, and/or critiqued during a time of great change in terms of industrialization and labor, technology, and shifting social ideas?  

## About

**Archives of Attention** is a digital collection, repository, and critical intervention into how the “attention economy” was experienced and conceptualized well before the term was coined.The project takes as its starting point the idea that attention, like money or time, is an increasingly scarce and valuable form of capital. What we attend to— whether texts, people, media, objects, or any other kind of spectacle—signals what we value and where we lay our intentions. 

This project asks: how  Can we look toward both objects (games, novels, toys, media) and what was written about those objects (reviews, critiques, promotions) to understand the nineteenth century roots of attention as a corollary to burgeoning ideas about leisure and labor? What types of attention were valued, and for what purposes? What genres were employed and developed to capture attention, from color lithography and trade cards to novels and serialized fiction. And finally, how might a humanities-driven study of these questions open up a space for thinking about how we read, define, and interpret the stakes of attention?
